This repository explores the Gaussian Process for predicting stock prices. 
The "Intra-Day" file is the main file showing the mapping and prediction of stock prices. It contains code and a visualization of the Gaussian Process, modifying the mean and kernels.
The "Kernels" file shows samples from different kernels.
The "Data" file contains the code for sourcing stock price data.
The "intra.csv" file is the data file used the "Intra-Day" file.
The "Images" file is me trying to make comparisons and playing around with some things.
